## Object-Oriented Programming

### Questions

- What is the difference between **method overloading** and **method overriding**?
- How do **abstract classes** differ from **interfaces**?
- What happens when multiple interfaces declare the same method signature?
- If several interfaces provide default implementations, how does the compiler decide which one to use?
- Can a class implement multiple interfaces? If so, how does it handle conflicting methods?

### Answers

- **Method Overloading** occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. **Method Overriding** happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.

- **Abstract classes** can have both abstract and concrete methods, while **interfaces** can only declare methods (Java 8 onwards allows default methods). An abstract class can have state (fields), whereas an interface cannot.

- When multiple interfaces declare the same method, the implementing class must provide an implementation. If the methods have different signatures, there is no conflict.

- If there are conflicting default methods, the implementing class must override the method and provide its own implementation.

- Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces. If the interfaces have conflicting methods, the class must override the method to resolve the conflict.

## Kotlin Language

### Questions

- What are the key features of Kotlin?
- How does Kotlin handle null safety?
- What is a data class in Kotlin?
- Explain the use of the `lateinit` keyword.
- What is the difference between `val` and `var`?

### Answers

- Kotlin features include null safety, extension functions, coroutines, and concise syntax. It is fully interoperable with Java.

- Kotlin handles null safety through nullable types. You must explicitly declare a variable as nullable using a question mark (e.g., `var name: String?`).

- A **data class** in Kotlin is a class that is primarily used to hold data. It automatically generates `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

- The `lateinit` keyword allows you to declare a non-null variable that will be initialized later. It can only be used with mutable properties.

- `val` declares a read-only variable, while `var` declares a mutable variable.

## Android Framework & SDK

### Questions

- What is the Android application lifecycle?
- Explain the difference between `Activity` and `Fragment`.
- What are Services in Android?
- How do you handle background tasks in Android?
- What is the role of the `AndroidManifest.xml` file?

### Answers

- The Android application lifecycle consists of several states: `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`. Each state has specific responsibilities and transitions.

- An `Activity` represents a single screen with a user interface, while a `Fragment` is a reusable portion of the UI that can be combined with other fragments within an activity.

- **Services** are components that run in the background to perform long-running operations without a user interface.

- You can handle background tasks using `AsyncTask`, `Handler`, or `WorkManager`. Each has its use cases depending on the task's complexity and requirements.

- The `AndroidManifest.xml` file declares the application's components, permissions, and configurations. It is essential for the Android system to understand the app's structure.

## Coroutines & Concurrency

### Questions

- What are coroutines in Kotlin?
- How do you launch a coroutine?
- What is the difference between `launch` and `async`?
- Explain structured concurrency.
- How do you handle exceptions in coroutines?

### Answers

- **Coroutines** are lightweight threads that allow asynchronous programming in Kotlin. They help manage background tasks without blocking the main thread.

- You can launch a coroutine using the `launch` function from a coroutine scope, such as `GlobalScope` or `CoroutineScope`.

- `launch` is used for coroutines that do not return a result, while `async` is used for coroutines that return a result wrapped in a `Deferred`.

- **Structured concurrency** ensures that coroutines are managed in a way that their lifecycle is tied to the scope they are launched in, preventing memory leaks.

- You can handle exceptions in coroutines using a `try-catch` block or by using a coroutine's `CoroutineExceptionHandler`.

## Architectures & Design Patterns

### Questions

- What is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture?
- Explain the Singleton design pattern.
- What is Dependency Injection?
- How does the Observer pattern work in Android?
- What is the purpose of the Repository pattern?

### Answers

- **MVVM** separates the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model). This separation enhances testability and maintainability.

- The **Singleton** design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Dependency Injection** is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This improves code modularity and testability.

- The **Observer** pattern allows an object (the subject) to notify other objects (observers) about changes in its state. In Android, this is commonly used with LiveData and ViewModel.

- The **Repository pattern** abstracts data sources and provides a clean API for data access. It separates the logic of data retrieval from the rest of the application.

## Data & Storage

### Questions

- What are the different storage options in Android?
- Explain SharedPreferences.
- How does SQLite work in Android?
- What is Room Persistence Library?
- What is the purpose of Content Providers?

### Answers

- Android provides several storage options: SharedPreferences, SQLite databases, files, and cloud storage.

- **SharedPreferences** is a key-value storage mechanism for saving small amounts of data, such as user preferences.

- **SQLite** is a lightweight relational database that allows you to store structured data in tables.

- The **Room Persistence Library** is an abstraction layer over SQLite that simplifies database access while providing compile-time checks for SQL queries.

- **Content Providers** enable data sharing between applications. They allow apps to access and manipulate data from other apps securely.

## Build, Dependencies & Tools

### Questions

- What is Gradle?
- How do you manage dependencies in Android?
- Explain the role of ProGuard.
- What are Android Build Variants?
- How do you create a custom Gradle task?

### Answers

- **Gradle** is a build automation tool that manages the build process in Android. It allows you to define dependencies, build configurations, and tasks.

- You manage dependencies in Android by declaring them in the `build.gradle` file. Gradle handles downloading and integrating them into your project.

- **ProGuard** is a tool that optimizes and obfuscates your code to reduce the APK size and protect it from reverse engineering.

- **Android Build Variants** allow you to create different versions of your app, such as free and paid versions, by combining build types and product flavors.

- You can create a custom Gradle task by defining it in the `build.gradle` file using the `task` keyword and specifying the actions to be performed.

## Testing & Code Quality

### Questions

- What are the types of testing in Android?
- Explain unit testing and UI testing.
- What is Espresso?
- How do you write a test case in JUnit?
- What is the purpose of linting in Android development?

### Answers

- The types of testing in Android include unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing.

- **Unit testing** focuses on testing individual components, while **UI testing** checks the user interface and user interactions.

- **Espresso** is a testing framework for writing UI tests in Android. It allows you to simulate user interactions and verify UI behavior.

- You write a test case in JUnit by creating a class that extends `JUnit` and annotating methods with `@Test`.

- **Linting** checks your code for potential errors and enforces coding standards. It helps maintain code quality and readability.

## Security

### Questions

- What are the best practices for securing Android apps?
- How do you implement secure data storage?
- Explain the concept of SSL pinning.
- What is Android Keystore?
- How do you handle sensitive information in your app?

### Answers

- Best practices for securing Android apps include using HTTPS, implementing secure data storage, and validating input data.

- You implement secure data storage by using encrypted SharedPreferences or the Android Keystore to store sensitive data.

- **SSL pinning** ensures that your app only accepts a specific SSL certificate, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

- The **Android Keystore** securely stores cryptographic keys and allows you to perform cryptographic operations without exposing the keys.

- To handle sensitive information, avoid hardcoding secrets in your code. Use environment variables or secure storage solutions.

## Accessibility & Miscellaneous

### Questions

- What is accessibility in Android?
- How do you implement accessibility features?
- Explain the importance of localization.
- What are Android permissions?
- How do you manage app resources?

### Answers

- **Accessibility** in Android ensures that apps are usable by people with disabilities. It includes features like screen readers and alternative input methods.

- You implement accessibility features by using content descriptions, accessibility labels, and proper layout structure.

- **Localization** is essential for reaching a broader audience. It involves translating app content and adapting layouts for different languages and regions.

- Android permissions control access to sensitive user data and device features. You must declare permissions in the manifest and request them at runtime.

- You manage app resources by organizing them in the `res` directory. Resources include strings, layouts, and images, which can be accessed programmatically.
